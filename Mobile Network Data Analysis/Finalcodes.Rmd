# "The following code snippet performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the "internal" and "external"
# degrees of a community in order to quantify its significance. Let us call the edges within a 
# community "internal" and the edges connecting the vertices of a community with the rest of the graph "external".
# The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no difference between the number of "internal" and "external" edges 
# incident to a vertex of the community. More internal than external edges show that the community is significant; less 
# internal than external edges show that the community is in fact an "anti-community". The p-value of the test performed by 
# this function will be close to zero in both cases; the value of the test statistic tells us whether we have a community or an anti-community."

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
